    <h3><span>Description</span></h3>
    <p>This is a great, quick, flavorful dish I learned while living in southern Israel. You can add spices to taste, but for the first go, try it this way. Makes 2 hearty servings. Serve with bread to sop up the sauce.</p>
    <h3><span>Ingredients</span></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 zucchini, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><span>Steps</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in zucchini; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in the crushed tomatoes and hot pepper sauce. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Make 4 wells in the tomato mixture, and crack the eggs into each well. Do not stir. Cover and cook until eggs are desired consistency, about 3 minutes for soft yolks. Carefully remove the eggs from the skillet and serve with the tomato sauce.</li>
        </ol>
